        "The previous error `PydanticUserError` indicates an incompatibility between `langchain-openai==0.1.0` and the installed Pydantic v2. This likely occurred because earlier attempts to fix import errors for `langchain.agents` led to downgrading `langchain` and `langchain-openai` to versions not fully compatible with Pydantic v2. To resolve this, I will uninstall existing `langchain` and `langchain-openai` packages and then install the latest stable versions of both. This approach ensures all Langchain components and their dependencies (like Pydantic and langchain-core) are aligned to compatible versions, which should resolve the Pydantic error and enable correct imports for the agent components.\n",
